# ESP Stress Test
This is a two-part repository containing C++ code for the sender and Python code for the receiver. 
This code is used to test the limits of the sender (in this case the ESP-WROOM-32) to see at what frequency we would be able to send a 40x40 `uint8_t` (1600 bytes) matrix (2D-array).
